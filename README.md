Terms and conditions for web scraping: There was a comment in the page source that said "Usage of azlyrics.com content by any third-party lyrics provider is prohibited by our licensing agreement. Sorry about that." Since I am not a third party lyric provider, I assumed it was acceptable to continue with this website.

The corpus includes lyrics from the first single off of folklore, Taylor Swift's album. 

The text was cleaned, and other information was extracted such as the writing credits.
